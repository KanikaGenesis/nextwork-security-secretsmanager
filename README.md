# Secure AWS Credentials with Secrets Manager

This project showcases how to protect sensitive AWS credentials (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key) in a web application by transitioning from hardcoded credentials to AWS Secrets Manager. It includes a simple FastAPI-based web app that lists S3 buckets, demonstrates the risks of hardcoding credentials, and walks through securing them using best practices.

## Key Features
- **AWS Secrets Manager**: Securely stores and retrieves AWS credentials.
- **GitHub Secret Scanning**: Detects and blocks pushes with hardcoded credentials.
- **Git Rebase**: Removes sensitive commits from repository history.
- **S3 Integration**: Lists S3 buckets using boto3.

## Tools and Concepts
- **Services Used**: AWS Secrets Manager, S3, IAM, GitHub.
- **Libraries**: boto3, FastAPI, Uvicorn.
- **Concepts**: Avoiding hardcoded credentials, secret rotation, commit history rewriting.
